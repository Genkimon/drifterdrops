# Drifter Drops

Changes drifters from harvestable to instant loot drops.

Loot tweaks:
* Added black coal as a potential drop to all drifters
* Drifters will now always drop something (mostly flax or black coal)
* Stronger drifters have a chance to drop multiple items and multiple amounts
* Temporal gears and gear drop chance remains unchanged
